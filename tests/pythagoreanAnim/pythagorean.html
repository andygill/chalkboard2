<h2>
Pythagorean Proof Animation Tutorial:
</h2>
<br>


<p>
In testing the current features and usability of animation in
ChalkBoard, we decided to recreate an existing animation. This
was done both to see how close we could reasonably get to the
original and also how difficult it would be to do so. The
animation that we chose for this experiment was an animated
proof of the Pythagorean theorem that can be found on wikipedia
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras-2a.gif" target="_blank">here</a>
<br><br>

<p>
This example looked nice, served a useful purpose, and was exactly the
type of animation we would like to be easily created with ChalkBoard.
It also was complicated enough that we felt like it would be a good
test of ChalkBoard's features, without being too complicated as to
require an exorbitant amount of time to create and analyze. In order to
see the construction of this example as I describe it, I would highly
recommend following along with the relatively simple source code provided
<a href="Main.hs" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>

<p>
In scripting up this and other examples, a general structure for
ChalkBoard animations using the Active language has begun to appear. First, the individual
actions of the animation are built up separately, for instance, in a 'let' clause.
This stage consists of building up all of the Active boards that will
be used to show an individual piece of the final animation. This can be
anything from an object moving across the screen, rotating,
fading into view, changing colors, or a ton of other possibilities.
The Active animation language really provides a lot of opportunities to be creative here.
<br><br>

<p>
In the Pythagorean example, I began by creating the background. I decided that in order to match 
the background of the wikipedia entry, I wanted a faded yellow background. To do this, I simply 
used the color yellow with an alpha value of 0.2. Because ChalkBoard assumes the default 
background to be white, this blends the yellow with the default background of yellow to produce a 
faded/light yellow similar to the example.
<br><br>

<p>
Next, I built up a basic triangle in the middle of the screen. To do this, I first created a nice 
3/4/5 triangle by giving the there points (-0.2,0.15) (-0.2,-0.15) and (0.2,-0.15) to the 
triangle constructor. This created the shape of the triangle, but I also wanted a black outline 
around it to match the original animation. To do this I used the pointsToLine function with takes 
a list of points and draws a line between the adjacently listed points. Notice that the first 
point is also listed last so that a line will be drawn back to the beginning to finish enclosing 
our triangle. Lastly, the triangle is finally given it's color by choosing (alpha black) over a 
transparent background for the line, and (alpha yellow) over a transparent background for the 
triangle shape, with the line being placed over the triangle.

While this finishes creating a simple triangle, this triangle itself is never actually displayed 
in the animation. Instead, this triangle is transformed in different ways to create the triangles 
that are actually displayed. For instance, the initial triangle shown in the animation is 
achieved by scaling this 'mainTriangle' by the value 1.5. The animation of this triangle 
shrinking down into it's final position is achieved by adding some Active functions. First, the 
triangle is lifted into the Active (applicative functor) world using pure. This changes the Board 
(RGBA->RGBA) into an Active ( Board (RGBA->RGBA) ), even though it currently remains constant 
over time. The next step is to start applying actions to the board. In this instance, we apply 
and 'activeScale' of 2/3 and an 'activeMove' up 0.2 units and right 0.15 units. These functions 
are basically the same as their original affine transformations, except that their effects are 
now displayed over time. A video of just this portion of the animation can be seen to the right 
(01largeTriangle).

<p>
As a note, all of the font for this animation was actually added in last. In this tutorial, I 
will only be covering the creation of the actual animation, and not the insertion of font. This 
is predominantly because the only interesting parts that deal with the font are when to make the 
font labels appear and disappear. In terms of the timing, this is mostly just done to 
mirror the animation on wikipedia. Unfortunately, current Chalkboard animations using Active must 
be explicitly told when parts of an animation should
appear and disappear from the screen. While this will hopefully be taken care of with a couple 
new combinators in the near future, the functions that are currently used to tell Actives to only 
appear when they are in use are activeAppear and activeTempAppear. The function 
activeAppear makes it so that the Active Board will only appear when its action starts, but will 
remain visible after it has finished. The activeTempAppear function, on the other hand, changes 
the Active Board so that it will only be visible while the action is actually happening, not 
before or after the fact. The video of the first portion of the animation with the fonts inserted 
can be seen to the right (02largeTriangleWithABC).

Moving on the with actual animation, the next step was to create the four identical but rotated 
triangles that are displayed in the wikipedia graphic. These were created using the list 
comprehension for 'otherTriangles' that simply rotates the moved version of the original 
'mainTriangle' that was created. These triangles are then made to appear using the activeAppear 
function as described above. While they could have each been listed separately in the 'flicker' 
portion of the program (described later), I instead chose to apply an 'actMove' to each of these 
new triangles. This function simply moves the action of the given Active Board backwards in time 
by the given value. Using the list comprehension in otherTrianglesActive, each new triangle is 
made to appear a little bit later in time than the previous. Finally, this list of Active Boards, 
each represented one new triangle, is compressed into one Active Board using the 'over' function.
A video of this portion of the animation can be seen to the right (03actualOtherTriangles). The 
next part of the animation is just adding a couple missing pieces to the screen so that the 
full square can be clearly seen. A yellow square is added to the middle so that the entire 
larger square can be seen to be of size cxc, and therefore having an area of cÂ², as indicated by 
the accompanying text. This small portion of the animation can be seen to the right
(04actualColorSquare).

Next, we need to slide the top triangles down to match up with the lower triangles, as seen in 
the animation to the right (05actualSlideBoth). We also want an outline of the old triangles to 
remain behind so we can see where they originally came from (like in the original on wikipedia). 
This is done in two parts. The first part is to fade the existing triangles while also creating 
two new triangles, which will be the ones that actually slide down. The first part is done very 
similarly to how we used rotate to create the 'otherTriangles'. In this instance, however, a 
white triangle with an alpha value of 0.6 is simply placed where these two triangles used to be 
so that these triangles will now look faded. For the second part, we create the first triangle by 
moving the original 'mainTriangle' up to where it stopped to form the first of the four smaller 
triangles, and then from there apply an activeMove that will move it down to it's final position 
over time. We do the same thing with the second triangle, but we can just grab its original shape/
position from the head of the 'otherTriangles' list, and then activeMove this triangle down to 
it's final position on the right side. The effects of running just these individual animation 
parts can be seen in the animation to the right (06slideBoth), where you will notice the white 
triangles where the originals used to be. Those are the triangles used to fade the existing 
triangles, while the new ones simply move down to their new locations.

<p>
The last part of the animation is simply switching the organization of these shapes. Now that 
they are in their new positions, two new squares can be drawn covering this entire area that have 
side lengths of a and b, and thus areas of aÂ² and bÂ². This in effect concludes the proof that aÂ² 
+ bÂ² equals the original area of cÂ². In order to animate this part, I used the same general 
strategy as fading out the two original triangles in the last step. The two main differences are 
that this time I used yellow squares with alpha values of 0.8 instead so that the new squares 
would be a darker yellow instead of a lighter one, and that I also drew lines around the new 
squares as well to make them more clear. The squares to be faded in where just created as shapes 
in ChalkBoard and moved to the right locations. They were then faded in over time using the 
'fadeIn' function, which takes an alpha and RGB value of what color the shape should end up, as 
well as a Board Bool of the shape, and produces an Active (Board (RGBA->RGBA)). This Active 
Board consists of the shape fading in over time as the given color. The lines around the squares 
are then drawn over the top of these fading in squares using the same pointsToLine function as 
I did when drawing the original 'mainTriangle' above. This final part of the animation can be 
seen to the right (07actualFinalFade).
<br><br>



<p>
In this example, each part of the animation is created separately and then must be strung
together to create the full animation. The reason we did it this way was simply because, at the 
moment, most of the animations we have attempted have been easier to create this way (by
making smaller animations that are then combined together). These smaller animation pieces often 
use some of the same basic structures repeatedly and so can be pretty easy to create in this way. 
For instance, the originally defined triangle, which isn't actually displayed itself, is rotated 
and moved around a lot in order to create all of the other triangles in the scene.
While longer animations can definitely be created using these functions and actMove, it seems
to be much easier at the moment to keep these individual animations pretty basic and then string 
them together using some combinator such as the 'flicker' function.
<br><br>

<p>
Using the 'flicker' function in this way is the second major stage we use for creating 
an animation at the moment. Using the 'flicker' function, animations can be strung 
together, one after the other, with the newer animations being stacked on top of the 
older ones. The length of time each individual animation component takes to be 
performed can be specified using the 'taking' function inside the list of 
animations given to 'flicker'. This can stretch out certain actions to take longer amounts of 
time or compress other actions to take short periods of time. If some parts of the animation
need to appear when they start, or disappear after they are completed, this has to be done using 
the activeAppear and activeTempAppear functions as described earlier. We do hope to implement
a slightly easier way to specify when certain boards should appear and/or disappear soon though.

<p>
This use of 'flicker' basically is what manages the ordering and timing of the
individual parts of the animation that were created. It returns a single
Active board that can then be used to display the whole animation (or used in turn
to create an even bigger animation, hierarchically). In terms of displaying the
animation, this will largely be done the same way for most animations. First, the
Active board must be turned into a Player using the 'byFrame' or 'realTime'
functions. The Player is then passed to the 'play' function to retrieve the next
image of the animation (or Nothing, if the animation is finished). Finally, this 
retrieved image can then be used in any way that ChalkBoard can use a Board. 
Traditionally, the image will be displayed on the screen using 'drawChalkBoard' or 
saved into a movie file with 'frameChalkBoard' (possibly both). After this, the 
process of calling 'play' on the Player must be repeated to extract the next image. 
This is usually placed into a simple loop that extracts and then displays or saves 
the returned frame. In the future, we will probably include predefined functions to 
perform each of these most basic cases automatically, though obviously there are
other actions that can also be taken with the returned Boards, if the user desires.
