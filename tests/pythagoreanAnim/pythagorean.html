<h2>
Pythagorean Proof Animation Tutorial:
</h2>
<br>


<p>
In testing the current features and usability of animation in
ChalkBoard, we decided to recreate an existing animation. This
was done both to see how close we could reasonably get to the
original and also how difficult it would be to do so. The
animation that we chose for this experiment was an animated
proof of the Pythagorean theorem that can be found on wikipedia
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pythagoras-2a.gif" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>

<p>
This example looked nice, served a useful purpose, and was exactly the
type of animation we would like to be easily created with ChalkBoard.
It also was complicated enough that we felt like it would be a good
test of ChalkBoard's features, without being too complicated as to
require an exorbitant amount of time to create and analyze. In order to
see the construction of this example as I describe it, I would highly
recommend following along with the relatively simple source code provided
<a href="Main.hs" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>

<p>
In scripting up this and other examples, a general structure for
ChalkBoard animations using the <tt>Active</tt> language has begun to appear. First, the 
individual actions of the animation are built up separately, for instance, in a <tt>let</tt> 
clause. This stage consists of building up all of the <tt>Active Board</tt>s that will
be used to show an individual piece of the final animation. This can be
anything from an object moving across the screen, rotating,
fading into view, changing colors, or a ton of other possibilities.
The <tt>Active</tt> animation language really provides a lot of opportunities to be creative here.
<br><br>

<p>
In the Pythagorean example, I began by creating the background. I decided that in order to match 
the background of the wikipedia entry, I wanted a faded yellow background. To do this, I simply 
used the color yellow with an alpha value of 0.2. Because ChalkBoard assumes the default 
background to be white, this blends the yellow with the default background of white to produce a 
faded/light yellow similar to the example.
<br><br>

<p>
Next, I built up a basic triangle in the middle of the screen. To do this, I first created a nice 
3/4/5 triangle by giving the there points (-0.2,0.15) (-0.2,-0.15) and (0.2,-0.15) to the 
<tt>triangle</tt> constructor. This created the shape of the triangle, but I also wanted a black 
outline around it to match the original animation. To do this I used the <tt>pointsToLine</tt> 
function with takes a list of points and draws a line between the adjacently listed points. 
Notice that the first point is also listed last so that a line will be drawn back to the 
beginning to finish enclosing our triangle. Lastly, both parts of the triangle are finally given 
their colors by using <tt>choose (alpha black) transparent</tt> and <tt>choose (alpha yellow) 
transparent</tt> for the lines and triangle shape, respectively. This makes the lines black over 
a transparent background (so that we can see the triangle behind them) and the triangle yellow 
with a transparent background (so that we can see the screen background color behind it).

<p>
While this finishes creating a simple triangle, this triangle itself is never actually displayed 
in the animation. Instead, this triangle is transformed in different ways to create the triangles 
that are actually displayed. For instance, the initial triangle shown in the animation is 
achieved by scaling this <tt>mainTriangle</tt> by the value 1.5. The animation of this triangle 
shrinking down into its final position is achieved by adding some <tt>Active</tt> functions. 
First, the triangle is lifted into the <tt>Active</tt> (applicative functor) world using 
<tt>pure</tt>. This changes the <tt>Board(RGBA->RGBA)</tt> into an 
<tt>Active(Board(RGBA->RGBA))</tt>, even though it currently remains constant over time. The next 
step is to start applying actions to the board. In this instance, we apply an 
<tt>activeScale</tt> of 2/3 and an <tt>activeMove</tt> up 0.2 units and right 0.15 units. These 
functions are basically the same as their original affine transformations, except that their 
effects are now displayed over time. A video of just this portion of the animation can be seen 
here (01largeTriangle).

<p>
As a note, all of the font for this animation was actually added in last. In this tutorial, I 
will only be covering the creation of the actual animation, and not the insertion of font. This 
is predominantly because the only interesting parts that deal with the font are when to make the 
font labels appear and disappear. In terms of the timing, this is mostly just done to 
mirror the animation on wikipedia. Unfortunately, current ChalkBoard animations using 
<tt>Active</tt> must be explicitly told when parts of an animation should
appear and disappear from the screen. While this will hopefully be taken care of with a couple 
new combinators in the near future, the functions that are currently used to tell 
<tt>Active</tt>s to only appear when they are in use are <tt>activeAppear</tt> and 
<tt>activeTempAppear</tt>. The function <tt>activeAppear</tt> makes it so that the <tt>Active 
Board</tt> will only appear when its action starts, but will remain visible after it has 
finished. The <tt>activeTempAppear</tt> function, on the other hand, changes the <tt>Active 
Board</tt> so that it will only be visible while the action is happening, and not before or after 
the fact. A video of the first portion of the animation with the fonts now inserted can be seen 
here (02largeTriangleWithABC).

Moving on the with actual animation, the next step was to create the four identical but rotated 
triangles that are displayed in the wikipedia graphic. These were created using the list 
comprehension in <tt>otherTriangles</tt> that simply rotates the moved version of the original 
<tt>mainTriangle</tt>. These triangles are then made to appear using the <tt>activeAppear</tt> 
function as described above. While they could have each been listed separately in the 
<tt>flicker</tt> portion of the program (described later), I instead chose to apply the 
<tt>actMove</tt> function to each of these new triangles. This function simply moves the action 
of the given <tt>Active Board</tt> backwards in time by the given value. Using the list 
comprehension in <tt>otherTrianglesActive</tt>, each new triangle is made to appear a little bit 
later in time than the previous. Finally, this list of <tt>Active Board</tt>s, each representing 
one new triangle, is compressed into a single <tt>Active Board</tt> using the <tt>overList</tt> 
function. This function just calls <tt>over</tt> a bunch to overlay all the elements of the list. 
A video of this portion of the animation can be seen here (03otherTriangles). The next part 
of the animation is just adding a couple missing pieces to the screen so that the full square can 
be clearly seen. A yellow square is added to the middle so that the larger square can be seen to 
have a size of c x c. This larger square therefore has an area of c&sup2;, as indicated by the 
accompanying text. This small portion of the animation can also be seen above
(04fillSquare).

Next, we need to slide the top triangles down to match up with the lower triangles, as seen in 
the animation to the right (05actualSlide). We also want an outline of the old triangles to 
remain behind so we can see where they originally came from (like in the original on wikipedia). 
This is done in two parts. The first part is to fade the existing triangles to leave behind as 
the outlines of where the old triangles used to be, and the second is to 
create two new triangles, which will be the ones that actually move. This is done 
similarly to how we used rotate to create <tt>otherTriangles</tt>. In this instance, however, a 
white triangle with an alpha value of 0.6 is placed where these two triangles used to be 
so that they will appear faded. For the second part, we create the first triangle by 
moving the original <tt>mainTriangle</tt> up to the right position and then applying an 
<tt>activeMove</tt> to move it down to its final position over time. We do pretty much the same 
thing with the second triangle, but we can instead just grab its original shape/position from the 
head of the <tt>otherTriangles</tt> list, and then <tt>activeMove</tt> it down to its final 
position on the right side. The effects of running just these individual animation parts (without 
all of the prior parts) can be seen in the animation above (06slideBoth). You may notice the 
white triangles where the originals used to be. Those are the triangles used to fade the existing 
triangles (which are left out in this version, so we can see only what is added in this step), while the 
new ones simply move down to their new locations.

<p>
The last part of the animation is simply switching the organization of these shapes. Now that 
the triangles are in their new positions, two new squares can be drawn that cover the entire 
area. These squares have side lengths of a and b, and thus areas of a&sup2; and b&sup2;. This in 
effect concludes the proof that a&sup2; + b&sup2; equals the original area of c&sup2;. In order 
to animate this part, I used the same general strategy as fading out the two original triangles 
in the last step. The two main differences are that this time I used yellow squares with alpha 
values of 0.8 instead so that the new squares would be a darker yellow instead of a lighter one, 
and that I also drew lines around the new squares as well to make them more clear. The squares to 
be faded in where just created as shapes in ChalkBoard and moved to the right locations. They 
were then faded in over time using the <tt>fadeIn</tt> function, which takes an alpha and RGB 
value of what color the shape should end up, as well as a <tt>Board Bool</tt> of the shape, and 
produces an <tt>Active(Board(RGBA->RGBA))</tt>. This <tt>Active Board</tt> consists of the shape 
fading in over time as the given color. The lines around the squares are then drawn over the top 
of these fading in squares using the same <tt>pointsToLine</tt> function as I did when drawing 
the original <tt>mainTriangle</tt> above. This final part of the animation can be seen here 
(07finalFade).
<br><br>



<p>
In this example, each part of the animation is created separately and then must be strung
together to create the full animation. The reason we did it this way was simply because, at the 
moment, most of the animations we have attempted have been easier to create this way (by
making smaller animations that are then combined together). These smaller animation pieces often 
use some of the same basic structures repeatedly and so can be pretty easy to create in this way. 
For instance, the originally defined <tt>maintriangle</tt>, which isn't actually displayed 
itself, is rotated and moved around a lot in order to create all of the other triangles in the 
scene. While longer animations can definitely be created using the same functions we have used to 
build these smaller animation and the <tt>actMove</tt> function, it seems to be much easier at 
the moment to keep these individual animations pretty basic and then string them together using 
some combinator such as the <tt>flicker</tt> function.
<br><br>

<p>
Using the <tt>flicker</tt> function in this way is the second major stage we use for creating 
an animation at the moment. Using the <tt>flicker</tt> function, animations can be strung 
together, one after the other, with the newer animations being stacked on top of the 
older ones. The length of time each individual animation component takes to be 
performed can be specified using the <tt>taking</tt> function inside the list of 
animations given to <tt>flicker</tt>. This can stretch out certain actions to take longer amounts 
of time or compress other actions to take short periods of time. If some parts of the animation
need to appear when they start, or disappear after they are completed, this has to be done using 
the <tt>activeAppear</tt> and <tt>activeTempAppear</tt> functions as described earlier. We do, 
however, hope to implement a slightly easier way to specify when certain boards should appear and/
or disappear soon.
<br><br>

<p>
This use of <tt>flicker</tt> is basically what manages the ordering and timing of the
individual parts of the animation that were created. It returns a single
<tt>Active Board</tt> that can then be used to display the whole animation (or used in turn
to create an even bigger animation, hierarchically). In terms of displaying the
animation, this will largely be done the same way for most animations. First, the
<tt>Active Board</tt> must be turned into a <tt>Player</tt> using either the <tt>byFrame</tt> 
function (which takes a desired frame rate), or the
<tt>realTime</tt> function. The <tt>Player</tt> is then passed to the <tt>play</tt> function to 
retrieve the next image of the animation (or <tt>Nothing</tt>, if the animation is finished). 
Finally, this retrieved image can then be used in any way that ChalkBoard can use a 
<tt>Board</tt>. Traditionally, the image will be displayed on the screen using 
<tt>drawChalkBoard</tt> or saved into a movie file with <tt>frameChalkBoard</tt> (possibly both). 
After this, the process of calling <tt>play</tt> on the <tt>Player</tt> must be repeated to 
extract the next image. This is usually placed into a simple loop that extracts and then displays 
or saves the returned frame. In the future, we will probably include predefined functions to 
perform each of these most basic cases automatically, though obviously there are
other actions that can be taken with the returned <tt>Board</tt>, if the user desires. The full 
animation can finally be seen here (Pythagorean Proof Animation). It was produced as a video by 
simply saving each of the returned boards to a video file using the <tt>frameChalkBoard</tt> 
function after opening a default ChalkBoard write stream.
