ChalkBoard is packaged with cabal, and is shipped with a number of
tests which are disabled by default (if you want to just *use* the
library, then you do not need to build these tests, obviously).
The ChalkBoard server is always built.

This page lists the various options for the cabal package,
as well as listing the tests available.

### Server

The server, called chalkboard-server, is found in the `server` directory.

### Examples

There are two examples provided, `example` and `simple`.

    $ cabal configure -fexample

`example`, in `examples/example`, gives a trivial example 
of spinning boxes.

    $ cabal configure -fsimple

`simple`, in `examples/simple`, gives a small number of tests,
and was use as material for this tutorial.

### Tests

There are two test suits, one for the front end, and one for the backend.

    $ cabal configure -ftest1 -fcbbe1

`test1`, in `tests/test1`, is our primary testing system. 

### Benchmark

ChalkBoard ships with `chalkmark`, a basic timing test. At some point
in the future it will output a number, the chalkmark. It lives in 
`tests/chalkmark`.
