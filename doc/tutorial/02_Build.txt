### Building Standalone Binary that uses ChalkBoard

To build your first ChalkBoard example, type in (or cut and paste) this example
into a file Example.hs

    -- Example.hs
    import Graphics.ChalkBoard

    main = ....

This gives the first flavor of ChalkBoard. We

 * initialize a ChalkBoard viewer, giving us a ChalkBoard handle inside a scope.
 * ...
 * [For the advanced users] the code passed as a continuation to `startChalkBoard`
is not run inside the main thread (which is reserved for OpenGL), but is run
in another thread.

Compiling this file with GHC gives a binary that uses ChalkBoard. We use the notation `$`
to signify a command to be typed in.

    $ ghc --make Example.hs

This binary can be executed.

    $ ./Example.hs

This brings up the ChalkBoard viewer on the screen, with the default size of 400x400,
and a rather boring red background.

This completes the first example. In our next example, we introduce some basic shapes.

#### ChalkBoard and GHCi

For technical reasons, OpenGL (which ChalkBoard uses) and GHCi do not interact well. To mitigate this,
we have provided the ChalkBoard server, which accepts commands from the GHCi
command line. We discuss using this a special ChalkBoard Server section. All
the commands that we present in this and the following sections can equally
be used in stand alone or server modes; the only difference is in initialization.
