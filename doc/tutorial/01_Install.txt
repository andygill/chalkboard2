Installing ChalkBoard is easy, using the `cabal install` command.

    $ cabal install ChalkBoard

ChalkBoard depends on a number of Haskell packages, all available on <A HREF="http://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a>.
`cabal install ChalkBoard` should take care of this. 


### Possible Issues

We have tested ChalkBoard on Linux and OSX. Your milage may vary on Windows.

####  MacOSX

One that might cause an issue is the DevIL library, `Codec-Image-DevIL`. We needed found the underlying C library,
as loaded via the `port` OSX package manager, was unable to load .gif files properly. This may have been fixed.
